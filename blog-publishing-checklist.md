## Cross-Posting Strategy

3. **LinkedIn** (short version + link)
4. **Twitter/X** (thread with screenshots)
5. **Reddit** (r/java, r/programming - be careful not to spam)
6. **Konveyor Slack** (#general or #konveyor-users)

## Engagement

### Day of Publication

- [ ] Track analytics (views, shares, clicks)
- [ ] Note questions for potential follow-up posts

## Follow-Up Content Ideas

   - Complete workflow
   - Before/after comparison
   - Lessons learned

4. **Advanced Topics:** "Customizing and Extending the Rule Generator"

## Analytics to Track

- Page views / unique visitors
- Time on page (target: 2+ minutes)
- Click-through rate to GitHub
- GitHub stars/forks increase
- Issues/discussions opened
- Social media engagement (likes, shares, comments)

## Success Metrics

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk:** Technical errors in demo

- **Mitigation:** Emphasize human review, testing, and validation process

**Risk:** Low engagement
- **Mitigation:** Cross-post widely, engage in comments, share in relevant communities

**Risk:** Overwhelming support requests
