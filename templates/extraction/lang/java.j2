**Java Detection Instructions:**
For Java code patterns (classes, annotations, imports), use these fields:
- **provider_type**: Set to "java" (or leave null for auto-detection)
- **source_fqn**: Fully qualified class name (e.g., "javax.ejb.Stateless")
- **location_type**: One of:
  - **IMPORT**: For detecting import statements of specific classes (e.g., "import org.example.ClassName;")
  - **TYPE**: For detecting when a class is used as a type (field type, parameter type, return type, variable declaration)
    * Use this when the pattern is a CLASS that appears in code as a type reference
    * Example: "PathMatchConfigurer" used as parameter type in "void config(PathMatchConfigurer c)"
  - **METHOD_CALL**: For detecting specific METHOD NAME invocations (pattern should be method name, not class name)
    * Use this when the pattern is a METHOD that is being called
    * Example: pattern "getSomething" to find calls to "object.getSomething()"
    * DO NOT use for detecting usage of a class - use TYPE instead
  - **ANNOTATION**: For annotation usage (e.g., @Deprecated, @Stateless)
  - **INHERITANCE**: For detecting class inheritance (extends/implements)
  - **PACKAGE**: For detecting package references
- **file_pattern**: Can be null

**Maven Dependency Detection Instructions:**
For Maven dependency changes (pom.xml), use these fields:
- **provider_type**: Set to "java" (the java provider handles Maven dependencies)
- **category**: MUST set to "dependency"
- **source_fqn**: Maven coordinates in format "groupId:artifactId" (e.g., "mysql:mysql-connector-java" or "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
- **alternative_fqns**: CRITICAL - Include Maven relocations! Many Maven artifacts have been relocated:
  * "mysql:mysql-connector-java" → "com.mysql:mysql-connector-j" (relocated in 8.0+)
  * If the migration guide mentions a dependency change, check if it's a Maven relocation
  * Include BOTH the old and relocated coordinates in alternative_fqns (e.g., ["com.mysql:mysql-connector-j"])
  * Maven automatically resolves relocations, so the analyzer will see the NEW coordinates even if pom.xml has OLD ones
- **location_type**: null (not needed for dependency detection)
- **file_pattern**: null

**Configuration File Detection Instructions:**
For property/configuration file patterns (application.properties, application.yaml), use these fields:
- **provider_type**: Set to "builtin"
- **source_fqn**: SIMPLE regex pattern to match the property. Use `.*` for wildcards and escape dots with \\\\ (e.g., "spring\\.data\\.mongodb\\.host")
- **file_pattern**: Regex pattern to match configuration files (e.g., ".*\\.(properties|yaml|yml)")
- **location_type**: null (not needed for builtin provider)
- **category**: "configuration"

Example for Spring Boot property migration:
```json
{
  "source_pattern": "spring.data.mongodb.host",
  "target_pattern": "spring.mongodb.host",
  "source_fqn": "spring\\.data\\.mongodb\\.host",
  "provider_type": "builtin",
  "file_pattern": ".*\\.(properties|yaml|yml)",
  "location_type": null,
  "category": "configuration"
}
```
