1. **{{ build_file }}** - Maven project file with:
   - Parent: Spring Boot or appropriate framework at SOURCE version
   - Minimal dependencies needed for the patterns
   - Java version (11 or 17)
   - CRITICAL: All <dependency> entries MUST include a <version> tag
   - Exception: Only omit <version> for spring-boot-starter-* dependencies
     (they inherit from parent)
   - For all other dependencies (mysql-connector-java, etc.), explicitly specify a version

2. **{{ main_file }}** - Main application with:
   - Package: com.example
   - Code using each deprecated pattern
   - Comments: // Rule {{ source }}-to-{{ target }}-00001

{% if config_file_instructions %}{{ config_file_instructions }}{% endif %}

For Java patterns:
- IMPORT location: Add actual import statements at the top of the file
  (e.g., import org.example.ClassName;)
- METHOD_CALL location: Call a method on the specified class instance
  (e.g., configurer.setUseTrailingSlashMatch(false);)
  * You MUST include an actual method invocation like object.methodName()
  * Just importing or declaring the type is NOT enough - you must CALL a method on it
- PACKAGE location: Use @Value("${{ '{{property}}' }}") or @ConfigurationProperties
- TYPE location: Use class/interface in field declarations or method signatures
- ANNOTATION location: Use @Annotation on classes/methods
- DEPENDENCY location: Include in pom.xml dependencies with explicit <version> tags
- CONFIG FILE patterns: Add actual property in application.properties or application.yaml

CRITICAL: When import statements are shown above with
"YOU MUST INCLUDE THESE EXACT IMPORT STATEMENTS", add them EXACTLY as shown
at the top of your Java file, after the package declaration.

CRITICAL FOR MAVEN DEPENDENCIES:
- spring-boot-starter-web: no version needed (managed by parent)
- spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: no version needed (managed by parent)
- spring-boot-starter-test: no version needed (managed by parent)
- mysql-connector-java: MUST include <version>8.0.33</version>
- postgresql: MUST include <version>42.6.0</version>
- Any non-Spring Boot dependency: MUST include explicit <version> tag
